# Movies-ETL1

Note to grader: I did not upload the Resources file and added it to gitignore due to the large file size. I just added wikipedia_movies.json, movies_query.png and ratings_query.png to the main branch

## Project Overview
In this project, I was tasked to extract, transform, and load (ETL) the web-scraped wikipedia data for a list of movies.

## Resources
- Data Source: wikipedia-movies.json, movies.csv, ratings.csv
- Software: PostGreSQL, pgAdmin 4

## Results and Summary

- The successful ETL has yielded the uploaded IPYNB and PNG files that are included in this repository.
